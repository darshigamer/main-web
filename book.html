  <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
  <h2>YOU ARE A PRODUCT</h2>
  
  <p>Hey, buddy, how are you doing? Aren’t you glad that you bought this book!
Well, we are going to go on a journey together. And as long as you are
reading this book, I will be your friend. The only case in which this doesn’t
apply is if you illegally downloaded this book, in which case, fuck you.
This book is about insanely practical ideas to free you from all bullshit.
Let me start by saying this: a lot of this was supposed to be your parents’ job.
I am not gonna say anything bad about your parents. All I am saying is: if
people were products, then what we see around us are really shitty ones. So,
clearly, parents are royally fucking up their jobs.
Let me give you an introduction of the world you have been brought
into:
The world doesn’t give a flying fuck about you. This world is a place
full of people that will come in the form of friends, lovers and well-wishers;
in the form of emotional adhesives, neatly packaged dreams and aspirational
lollipops; in the form of saviours, fixers and salespersons. We are gonna talk
about them all.
Anyway, when the time comes, a lot of them will take complete
advantage of you, rid you of your emotional innocence and turn your world
upside down. It will most definitely happen, history tells you that, no matter
who you are or what you do—rich, talented, genius, pretty, strong, powerful,
polite, kind, or careful.
So, do you feel prepared?
Let’s start with you. You are a product. You are a product with hope
attached to it. What does that mean? It means that, one day, you are meant to
become this awesome, functional unit capable of choosing jobs, careers,
relationships, environments and economies on your own volition—that’s the
hope. The better the choices, the better the product you are—that’s the simple
law on the basis of which the world judges you.
So, here are a few things about you:

A person is not born ready.

A person has to be made ready.
The person is emotional in nature.
The person does not know how to learn in the beginning; it knows how
to absorb, which means it learns whatever it absorbs from its
surroundings. I am talking about when you were a kid.
The person has to learn how to learn.
The person can think, but does not know how to think, which is why it
cannot learn how to learn. This may be confusing, but it will become
clear later in the book.
A person’s emotional responses to different experiences create
interpretations of those experiences, which the person assumes to be
true. Therefore, emotional responses become one of the earliest
teachers of the person.
‘Emotional responses’ is a garbage teacher, because as a kid, the
emotional intelligence is underdeveloped.
Because the person learns by absorption, the parents and surroundings
become the other teachers. Instead of teaching the person how to
think, parents and surroundings teach what to think—thereby
becoming terrible teachers themselves.
Teaching what to think stops the product from learning how to think
and since the person doesn’t learn how to think, it grows up to be
confused and clueless regarding how to deal with this world.
In conclusion, the product is very likely to be screwed. The product is you.</p>

<h2>NOBODY IS BORN AN IDIOT</h2>

  <p>
    
    You may have said this on many occasions in your life: people are fucking

idiots.

But nobody is born an idiot—we unknowingly choose to be idiotsbecause we are not taught the methodologies of how to think. When devoid

of this knowledge, people unconsciously view what they have learned from

parents, surroundings and emotional responses as factual learnings.
As you grow older and life becomes harder, without the ability of ‘how
to think’, one naturally falls back on what one knows—which strengthens
these ‘factual’ learnings even more, so much so that at a certain age, they can
become unchangeable ideas, biases, prejudices and practices that the
individual can no longer abandon.
Now, you may be thinking, what the fuck is he talking about? Factual
learnings? How to think? What to think? Here is an example: imagine
growing up in a place where you only interacted with people of one group.
Now, also imagine this group of people having a very strict, single-belief
system, strict ideologies and strict doctrines on morality, how to live your
life, what’s decent and what’s not. Now, on top of that, also imagine that they
have notions which are not so kind about people of other groups, or other
belief systems, or even about women. When you teach the children to think
exactly like that, it would be called teaching somebody: what to think.
Makes sense?
If you are growing up with such teachings, those would be called factual
learnings, because they may appear factual to you, but aren’t necessarily so.
They are based on fear and ignorance.
So, with time, when they are not corrected by verification, these factual
learnings become factual truths to people. Factual truths means they are
incontestable to those who believe them, and they most probably will die by
them. And once you believe something that strongly, you become its avid
defender. Once we become defenders, we become groups. Once we become
groups, we disagree with other groups, and fight, and vote, and celebrate, and
denigrate on behalf of whichever ideas align most closely to our ‘factual’
truths.

  <h2>THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AROUND YOU</h2>
  
  <p>
    
    Based on people who are taught how to think and people who are taught what

to think, these are the results:

A person brought up on what to think tends to follow ideas,
ideologies and ways of living that echo a relationship with familiarity.
We do so, because we feel safe with familiarity. Whatever is familiar
to you is known to you well. So, you’re most comfortable with it.

A person brought up on how to think tends to question, filter and may

abandon ideas, ideologies and ways of living that echo a relationship
with familiarity. Familiarity, although safe, does not guarantee
soundness.
A person brought up on what to think tends to feel threatened by alien
ideas, things, or people, which may end up pushing them more
towards what they know and are familiar with.
A person brought up on how to think, when confronted by alien ideas
or people, takes an interest in understanding and figuring them out. At
the same time, they also inspect the first impressions their mind
created. They are not threatened, because practising how to think over
the years creates curiosity and an investigative attitude. Therefore, any
person, thing or idea that is alien becomes food for thought.
A person brought up on what to think inclines towards asking for
solutions for their problems, instead of thinking and finding out things
by themselves. This explains the insatiable need for self-help books,
the lack of self-reliance, and the explosion of ‘clever’ people online,
teaching people how to be successful, to be a man, a millionaire, a
strong woman, smart, clever, slick, handsome and beautiful all at
once.
The person who knows how to think will try to find solutions for their
problems by thinking on their own, using methods of reasoning, with
consideration to mental harmony and bringing smoothness in the
functioning of their life. To expand the scope of their knowledge,
however, they will read books, watch videos and consume all
available information. They seek knowledge because knowledge
contains perspectives. And the cultivation of how to think requires a
collection of as many varied perspectives as one can gather.
Lastly, a person who wasn’t brought up on ‘what to think’ still
functions just the same as people who were taught what to think. It
happens because one can be deprived of parental guidance, but that is
only one of the teachers. The other teachers, such as surroundings and
their emotional responses, still teach them ‘what to think’. Basically,
‘how to think’ cannot be self-taught during the developmental years of a person. You may cite a few exceptions, but this book isn’t about

exceptional people, it’s about people.

    <h2>YOUR PARENTS PROBABLY MESSED UP</h2>
  <p>
    Why are parents largely producing products that are unprepared to face the

challenges of this world?

It is a very important question, also a fantastic one. It is both important
and fantastic because it sits on the assumptions that:
All parents want to be parents in the first place.
People who become parents are mentally prepared to be parents.
People who become parents are mentally fit to be parents.
Do you know how many reasons there are for having a child?
One can become a parent because the guy forgot to pull out, or the girl
—out of some ancient, primitive urge—commanded the guy to not pull out,
or he believed he had pulled out but the result said otherwise. People have
babies because they like babies, or because they have recently been feeling a
sense of incompleteness, or because they hope it will make their lives
purposeful again. People have babies because they have reached the age
society has deemed right to have a baby. People have babies because it
appears to be a viable strategy to save their marriage, or because one of the
partners wants to have a baby, and the other complies. People have babies so
the baby can grow up to fulfil the unfulfilled dreams of either of the parents.
There is a great chance that you might have been born from one of those
reasons. Ideally speaking, there should be a strategy. You are bringing a
fucking life into this world, and that person is gonna grow and contribute in
many ways to this world. They are gonna vote, follow ideologies, make
people money—which is what a job is—find love, marry, and do a lot of
other things, like write shitty poetry in their teens.
If they are not a responsible person, they are gonna be hurting a lot of
people. And if they grow up to be a douchebag, you are indirectly responsible
for hurting all the people that douche is going to hurt. If they grow up to be a
follower of ideologies that talk about dividing people, then the parents too are
responsible for creating one more follower.
